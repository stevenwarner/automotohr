            Historical payrolls are used for companies who transfer from one payroll provider to your payroll product after the start of a year. It's important to capture their previous payrolls during Company Onboarding to ensure year to date filings are accurate.

            An employer will need to gather all paystubs for every employee who was paid in the current calendar year. For previous quarters in this calendar year, the employer should gather quarterly payroll summaries for each employee and use these to enter quarter-to-date ("QTD") information to simplify this step (1 payroll per calendar quarter). These summaries should include any benefits, reimbursements, or exemptions for their employees.
