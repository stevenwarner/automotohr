                                    There's no need to set up separate accounts with each website; everything can be done through your <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?> account.
                                    We partner with a variety of sites and frequently offer our clients the opportunity to buy paid placements at a discounted rate.
                                    Once you've bought a paid placement, your listing will receive priority in job seekers' searches. When a candidate applies to a paid placement, their application will go straight to your <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?> account.</p>

                                    Our HR and Recruitment software will create a branded careers site for your organization that includes all of your job openings.
                                    Candidates can apply to openings directly from the page.
                                    Once your openings are online, you need job seekers to find them–but sometimes the traffic doesn't flow in immediately.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>One Site, Five Ways</strong><br/>
                                    Every careers site created through our HR and Recruitment software allows visitors to transmit job openings via email, Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn, with one-click social sharing buttons. Additionally, visitors can sign up to receive email notifications via RSS feed when you advertise a new job vacancy online.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>More Visitors = More Candidates</strong><br/>
                                    Because it's so easy for visitors to your <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?> branded careers site to share and receive information about new openings, your site is that much more likely to meet your HR and Recruitment advertising goals. And the more visitors you draw to your site, the more applications you'll receive.

Today's job-seekers frequently turn to social media when looking for their next career opportunities. Our social media sharing tool allows you to post openings to your social accounts directly within our HR and Recruiting software.</p>
                                <p><strong>Publicize Your Openings</strong><br/>
                                    You've created your job openings and posted them to your website; now you need to drive traffic to your career opportunities. In addition to posting to job boards like Ziprecruiter and Indeed, you can post your openings directly to your social media accounts–all without leaving <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?>.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Social Spread</strong><br/>
                                    Once you create an opening in <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?>, you'll be prompted to post the opening on your Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn accounts–all with just one click of the mouse. This way you can reach your network–the audience that already follows your organization and will be the most likely to be interested in your opportunities–and directly communicate your opportunities.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>Is Anybody Out There?</strong><br/>
                                    If you publish an opening but it isn't on websites like Indeed and Jobs2Careers, does it really exist? If you're having trouble attracting applicants to openings that have solely been published on your website, it might not feel that way.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Cast a Wide Net</strong><br/>
                                    When you post jobs online with our recruitment software, in addition to appearing on your Company careers site and jobs widget, <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?> automatically pushes the opening to multiple job search engines: Openings that appear on job search engines are much more likely to attract applicants. Active job seekers may not be checking your website every day for new positions, but chances are they're checking at least one of these boards for syndicated jobs. If you prefer that an opening doesn't syndicate to one or all of the boards, you can always turn off the syndication option. When a candidate applies to a listing they find on a job board, their application will go directly to your <?php echo STORE_NAME; ?> account.
