                                                        Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to

                                                        is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established

                                                        Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to
                                                        mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act
                                                        is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established
                                                        legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into
                                                        surrendering
