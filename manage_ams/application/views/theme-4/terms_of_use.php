Also, if you have bound your AutomotoSocial account to your Twitter account, you can easily share content from AutomotoSocial to Twitter. Further, AutomotoSocial allows third parties to look-up profile information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7. below).</p>
